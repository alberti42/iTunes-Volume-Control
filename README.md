iTunes-Volume-Control
=====================

Project moved to *Volume Control*
-----------------------------------

The app has changed from *iTunes Volume Control* to simply *Volume Control*. The reason is that iTunes does not exist any longer in recent macOS versions. Also, the app is not restricted to Music, since it also works for Spotify. For recent versions, please check the new app *[Volume Control](https://github.com/alberti42/Volume-Control)*. 

Description
-----------

* This app allows you to directly control the volume of Apple Music as well as of Spotify using ``volume-up`` and ``volume-down`` hotkeys from your keyboard.
* <s>It also allows you to control the same Music volume by means of your Apple Remote control.</s>
* In general, the app is useful to control the volume of AirPlay devices.
* You can adjust the finesse by which you change the volume.
* You can disable the heads-up display showing the volume status; this is useful when you are watching movies and you do not want to be distracted by the overlay volume display.
* Using the volume keys, the volume of the currently playing application (either Music or Spotify) is controlled. If neither Music nor Spotify are playing music. Then the global volume will be affected by the volume keys.
* With command key (⌘), you can change the behavior whether you control the volume of the system or of the music player.

Why do you need this app?
-------------------------

* The volume of Apple Music (previously iTunes) cannot be directly controlled from the keyboard. Volume keys only affect the global system volume.
* However, you might desire to directly control Apple Music's volume. This is especially relevant when listening to musing on external speakers like AirPlay devices. The volume level of AirPlay devices depends on Music volume, and not on the global volume, which as a standard behavior, you can set using the volume keys.
* <s>Music does not respond to volume change from your Apple Remote. Again, Apple Remote would only change the system volume settings, leaving unaffected the volume of your AirPlay devices.</s>
* Sometimes you might desire to hide the volume heads-up overlay from your screen, especially when watching movies. This app can be configured to hide it.

How to get it installed?
------------------------

It is simple. There is no need of any installation.

* Just download either this [zip file](https://github.com/alberti42/iTunes-Volume-Control/raw/master/iTunes%20Volume%20Control.zip).
* Decompress it.
* Drag the *iTunes Volume Control* app into your *Application* folder, or any other folder of your choice.
* Run the *iTunes Volume Control* app and a "music note" symbol will appear in your status bar.
* The first time you launch the app, you should authorize it through the *General* panel of *Security & Privacy* of the *System Preferences*.
* If you experience problems with permissions, especially if you upgrade from an old version, go to *Accessibility* panel of *Privacy* of the *System Preferences* (see screenshot below), and try to remove the entry "iTunes Volume Control". Make sure to close the app before you remove any permissions, or else you might prevent controlling the keyboard until you reboot the machine. Once you open the app again, you will then be asked to authorize the application again.
* Enjoy listening to your favorite music with better volume control.

Enabling control of iTunes and Spotify
--------------------------------------

The System Integrity Protection under Mojave requires you to grant *iTunes Volume Control* access to iTunes and Spotify. The first time the application attempts to control their volume, you will be asked with a dialog window to grant access.

If the application is running, but it is not able to read nor control the volume of the music player, you should then check that you have correctly granted access. You can change this in the *Automator* panel of *Security & Privacy* of the *System Preferences* (see screenshot below).

This app has been inspired by *Volume for iTunes* by Yogi Patel. The icon has been designed by Alexandro Rei. The apple remote control has been adapted from iremotepipe by Steven Wittens. The utilization of MacOS native HUD is based on code written by Benno Krauss and on reverse engineering of */System/Library/CoreServices/OSDUIHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/OSDUIHelper*.
