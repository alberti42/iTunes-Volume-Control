iTunes-Volume-Control
=====================

Description
-----------

* This little app allows you to control the iTunes volume using ``volume-up`` and ``volume-down`` hotkeys from your keyboard.
* It allows you also to control the same iTunes volume by means of your Apple Remote control.
* This is particularly useful to control the volume of AirPlay devices.

Why do I need this app?
-----------------------

* iTunes volume is normally not affected by changes of volume from the keyboard. This would only affect the system volume settings.
* This behavior is somehow undesired, especially when listening to musing on external speakers like AirPlay devices.
* iTunes does not respond to volume change from your Apple Remote. Again, this would only change the system volume settings, leaving unaffected the volume of your AirPlay device.

How to install it?
------------------

It is very simple. There is no need of any installation.

* Just download this [dmg package](https://github.com/alberti42/iTunes-Volume-Control/blob/master/iTunes%20Volume%20Control.dmg?raw=true).
* Open it.
* Drag the *iTunes Volume Control* app into your *Application* folder, or any other folder of your choice.
* Run the *iTunes Volume Control* app and a "music note" symbol will appear in your status bar.

Versions
--------

* 1.4.8: Updates are now signed with DSA. This improves the security, e.g., preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
* 1.4.7: Changed icons and graphics to be compatible with retina display.
* 1.4.6: Added the option to hide the icon from status bar. The icon reappears temporarily (for 10 seconds) by simply restarting the application. This gives the time to change the hide behavior as desired.
* 1.4.5: Added the option to enable/disable automatic updates occurring once a week
* 1.4.4: Corrected two bugs: the focus remains correctly on the selected application after changing the volume; cap lock does not prevent anymore the volume to be changed.
* 1.4.3: Corrected bug: properly hide transparent panels when animations are completed (thanks to Justin Kerr Sheckler)
* 1.4.2: Added iTunes icon to volume indicator. Corrected bug when iTunes is busy.
* 1.4.1: Added automatic upgrade capability.
* 1.4: Added "mute" control.
