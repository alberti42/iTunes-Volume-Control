iTunes-Volume-Control
=====================

Description
-----------

* This little app allows you to control the iTunes volume using ``volume-up`` and ``volume-down`` hotkeys from your keyboard.
* It allows you also to control the same iTunes volume by means of your Apple Remote control.
* This is particularly useful to control the volume of AirPlay devices.

Why do you need this app?
-----------------------

* iTunes volume is normally not affected by changes of volume from the keyboard. This would only affect the system volume settings.
* This behavior is somehow undesired, especially when listening to musing on external speakers like AirPlay devices.
* iTunes does not respond to volume change from your Apple Remote. Again, this would only change the system volume settings, leaving unaffected the volume of your AirPlay device.

How to get it installed?
------------------

It is very simple. There is no need of any installation.

* Just download this [dmg package](https://github.com/alberti42/iTunes-Volume-Control/raw/master/iTunes%20Volume%20Control.dmg).
* Open it.
* Drag the *iTunes Volume Control* app into your *Application* folder, or any other folder of your choice.
* Run the *iTunes Volume Control* app and a "music note" symbol will appear in your status bar.
* Make sure that *iTunes Volume Control* is enabled in the *Accessibility* panel of *Security & Privacy* of the *System Preferences* (see screenshot below); otherwise the application will not start.
* While iTunes is running, use the volume control keys to change its volume. This will not affect the main volume.

Versions
--------

* [1.5.3](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.5.3.zip): Made use of Mojave's native heads-up display to show the volume status.
* [1.5.2](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.5.2.zip): Fixed compatibility with Mojave. Prior versions are no longer supported. Fixed small bug on displaying the volume level when controlling it with the Apple Remote.
* [1.5.1](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.5.1.zip): Added the compatibility with Mac OS X versions greater than OS X 10.7 (Lion).
* [1.5](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.5.zip): Added the possibility to change the increment step on the volume. Backward compatible with Mavericks and Yosemite.
* [1.4.10](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.4.10.zip): Corrected bug on repositioning the volume indicator on right position.
* [1.4.9](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.4.9.zip): Started to prepare the transition to Yosemite look.
* [1.4.8](http://quantum-technologies.iap.uni-bonn.de/alberti/iTunesVolumeControl/iTunesVolumeControl-v1.4.8.zip): Updates are now signed with DSA. This improves the security, e.g., preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

The icon reappears temporarily (for 10 seconds) by simply restarting the application. This gives the time to change the hide behavior as desired.
